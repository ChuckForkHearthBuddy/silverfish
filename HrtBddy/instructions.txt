How to install:

- make a copy of the default routine (but don save it in routines folder)

- delete silverfish_HB.cs and DefaultRoutine_new.cs files
- delete Silverfish\cards and Silverfish\penalties folders
- (dont delete ai-folder, we need Helpfunctions.cs file, which is not in my source)

- copy ai, cards and penalties folders to DefaultRoutine\Silverfish folder
- copy new version of _carddb.txt file to DefaultRoutine\Silverfish\Data
- copy settings.txt file to DefaultRoutine\Silverfish\Data
