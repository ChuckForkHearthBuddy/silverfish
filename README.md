build instructions:
if your are using HR:
- copy the Programm.cs and the ai + cards folder in one folder, create a project out of it
- include HSRangerLib.dll from HR
- build it, and copy in the bin\Debug or Release-folder the _cardDB.txt file

Hrtbuddy:
- same like HR, only take the silverfish_HB.cs instead of Programm.cs
- there might be some builderrors i cant fix (dont own HB) if you know how to fix, let me know
